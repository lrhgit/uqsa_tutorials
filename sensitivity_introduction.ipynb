    "<div id=\"sec:introduction\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical introduction to sensitivity analysis is based on the\n",
    "presentation and examples found in [[saltelli_global_2008]](#saltelli_global_2008). To give\n",
    "the reader an even better hands on expericence of the topic, we have\n",
    "integrated the computations in a python notebook format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sensitivity anlyses reported in the literature are based on\n",
    "derviatives at set point or point of interest. Indeed such apporaches\n",
    "are based on the fact that the derivative of $\\partial Y_i/\\partial\n",
    "X_j$ of quantity of interest $Y_i$ as a function of an input variable\n",
    "$X_j$ can be thought of as the mathematical definition of the\n",
    "sensitivity of $Y_i$ versus $X_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what is important to keep in mind is that local derivatives\n",
    "are only informative at the set point in the parameter space at which\n",
    "they are computed, and do not provide information for the rest of the\n",
    "parameter space. Naturally, such a linearization will matter little\n",
    "for linear models, but for general, nonlinear models, care must be\n",
    "taken.  In particular this is important in situations when the input\n",
    "parameters are uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will therefore make use of methods based on the exploration of the\n",
