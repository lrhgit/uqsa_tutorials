    "\n",
    "This practical introduction to sensitivity analysis is based on the\n",
    "presentation and examples found in [[saltelli_global_2008]](#saltelli_global_2008). To give\n",
    "the reader an even better hands on experience of the topic, we have\n",
    "integrated the computations in a python notebook format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sensitivity analyses reported in the literature are based on\n",
    "derivatives at set point or point of interest. Indeed such approaches\n",
    "are based on the fact that the derivative of $\\partial Y_i/\\partial\n",
    "X_j$ of quantity of interest $Y_i$ as a function of an input variable\n",
    "$X_j$ can be thought of as the mathematical definition of the\n",
    "sensitivity of $Y_i$ versus $X_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what is important to keep in mind is that local derivatives\n",
    "are only informative at the set point in the parameter space at which\n",
    "they are computed, and do not provide information for the rest of the\n",
    "parameter space. Naturally, such a linearisation will matter little\n",
    "for linear models, but for general, nonlinear models, care must be\n",
    "taken.  In particular this is important in situations when the input\n",
    "parameters are uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Local versus global sensitivity analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation and useful purposes of sensitivity analysis\n",
    "\n",
    " * Parameter prioritization of parameters of high sensitivity (importance)\n",

    " * Parameter fixation of parameters of low sensitivity (importance)\n",

    "## Local approaches based on derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sensitivity analyses found in the scientific literature are based\n",
    "on derivatives.  This fact has naturally a rational basis as the\n",
    "partial derivative $\\partial y/\\partial Z_i$ of a model predicion $y$\n",
    "with respect to an input $Z_i$, can be understood as the mathematical\n",
    "representation of the sensitivity of $y$ with respect to $Z_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though a local, partial derivative approach is computationallyXS\n",
    "inexpensive it has in general limited usage for nonlinear models. The\n",
    "derivatives are linearizations of the model sensitivities around the\n",
    "point in the parameter space at which they are evaluated, and may only\n",
    "be extrapolated to provide information on the sensitivity in other\n",
    "regions of the parameter space in the case of a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first motivation you may consider the ratio areas of circle with\n",
    "diameter $D$ to the corresponding square with sides $D$, as an optimistic approximation of the portion of the parameter space you might represent with a one factor at the time (OAT) approach:"
