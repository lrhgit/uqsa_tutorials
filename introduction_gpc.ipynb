    "\n",
    "Polynomial chaos may be applied in a wide variety of situations. Requirements for convergence are simply that the function be square integrable with respect to the inner product associated with the orthogonal polynomials. In otherwords if the function has a finite variance, polynomial chaos may be applied without worrying too much. The caveat to this fact is that convergence may not necessarily be fast! The smoother the function the faster the convergence. Polynomial choas can handle discontinuities, however, it may be advisable to reformulate the problem in these situations (see Feinberg, Eck and Langtangen 2016...).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orthogonal polynomials\n",
    "As state above the polynomial chaos expansion consists of a sum of basis polynomials in the input parameters $\\mathbf{Z}$. \n",
    "By using orthogonal polynomials as the basis polynomials the efficiency of the convergence may be improved, and the use of the expansion in uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis is simplified.\n",
    "Orthogonality of functions is a general concept developed for functional analysis within an inner product space. Typically the inner product of two functions is defined as a weighted integral of the product of the functions over a domain of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "In particular for the purposes of polynomial chaos the inner product of two polynomials is defined as the expected value of their product, i.e. the integral of their product weighted with respect to the distribution of random input parameters.\n",
    "Two polynomials are orthogonal if their inner product is 0, and a set of orthogonal polynomials is orthogonal if every pair of distinct polynomials are orthogonal.\n",
